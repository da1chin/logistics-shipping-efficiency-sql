# Logistics Shipment Analysis (SQL)


## About Project
This project analyzes public shipment data to detect reasons for delivery delays, based on time of the day and traffic status. The goal with the project is to demonstrate SQL skills in aggregating, understanding and analyzing logistics data.

## Dataset
   - Source: Dataset sourced from Kaggle for the purpose of analyzing and visualizing shipping logistics.
   - Columns: Timestamp, Logistics_Delay, Traffic_Status, Waiting_Time, etc.

## Analysis
   1. Time of day impact
   - Afternoon shipments had the highest delay percentage (61.8%).
   - Evening, morning and night shipments showed similar levels (~55%)
   2. Traffic status impact
   - Average waiting time is not affected by traffic status.

## Tech Stack
   - SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
   - DBeaver as query tool

## How to use
   1. Load the dataset (smart-logistics-dataset.csv)
   2. Run the queries from 'Project-Delays.sql'.
   3. Compare results with the example outputs in 'outputs/'.

## Next steps of the project
   - Expanding analysis to cover delay reasons, routes, trends, etc. 
   - Building a Power BI dashboard.
